-sn   scan the network, host discovery, host reply the ICMP package. Eg. 
-sn   192.168.1.1
OR
-sn   192.167.1.1-254    192.168.1.1/24

-Pn   No ping
Treat all host as online, skip host discovery

-O   scan all 1000 ports and detect the OS

-sS    Stealth scan, only scan TCP without ACK flag

Output format: 
-oA    —all four formats <file>
-oX    — Xml format
-oN   —Normal, human-readable
-oG   —Grepable format 
-oS   —script
-v details
-vv more details
